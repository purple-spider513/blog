      <p class="sometext">
        That's right, after literally 1 second of working on a side project of a
        side project of a side project of a side project of a side project, I
        have finally returned! So back in May 2022, I originally wanted to make
        a game with my friend 100happee, and we called it Venus and the World of
        No Color. We worked on it a little bit, but then we decided to make
        another game called Astro. Then I started working on a game called One
        Minute Attack, which is an extension of a game I made for the Wowie! Jam
        4.0. Then I made another side project of that called Spicy Boy and Moist
        Girl(I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I didn't come up with the name!) which is a
        ripoff of Fireboy and Watergirl. I have finally decided to return to the
        game that started it all:
        <em><b>VENUS AND THE WORLD OF NO COLOR!!!!!!</b></em> Expect
        <em>(not too often)</em> blog posts about my progress and some
        screenshots! I am also really really really busy with school and stuff,
        especially I go to a big brain program called UMTYMP where we do college
        math ðŸ˜Ž but they give out too much homework which is sad. Welp gtg!
